# Flaskapp-->Sentiment-Analysis
This Flask web application leverages a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict sentiment based on user input.
Trained on a labeled dataset, the SVM model utilizes TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. 
The code includes data preprocessing steps, train-test splitting, and the implementation of a simple web interface.
Users can input text, and the application returns the predicted sentiment.
The project emphasizes simplicity and serves as a practical example of integrating machine learning into web applications using Flask.
